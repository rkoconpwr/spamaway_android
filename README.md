# SpamAway -- Android Application

Every e-mail application offers anti-spam module, filtering and scanning incoming messages for harmfulness. Defaultly, the SMS applications don't offer such functionality and even if it is, it's very limited. That's how the idea for this project came up.

The goal of this project was to create an anti-SPAM system that allows to recognize and react to such messages. The aim of the project was to introduce the subject of digital assistants without integretion with existing ones.
